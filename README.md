# Soft Body Simulation

My AP Physics C final project, in collaboration with Tracey Lin!

This is a VPython simulation of a soft body created using a spring-mass system. The object is composed of nodes of constant mass connected by springs of negligible mass. 
The simulation aims to demonstrate the behavior of deformable objects under external forces in an ideal world using the spring-mass system. Our soft body is able to 
stretch, compress, and (seemingly) bend while still maintaining its rigid nature just like how soft body objects (like jelly) would behave in the real world. 

You can change some constants (width, height, damping factor, mass, spring constant, and spring length) to mess around and see how that affects the soft body. We assume
that our soft body is in an ideal world where air resistance, friction, and pressure don't exist, but there is an automatic gravity applied. The user can also use the 
arrow keys to apply external forces and observe how the soft body behaves under these forces.
